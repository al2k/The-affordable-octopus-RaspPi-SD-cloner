***** The "Octopus" (previously Weeping Willow) affordable Rasp Pi SD Cloner / Writer *****

We (Naturebytes) had to come up with our own in-house method of mass SD card cloning / duplication to write the 300+ Kickstarter kit SD cards needed for the Wildlife Cam Kit.  

To copy a vast number of SD images we would have needed to invest in a professional SD card duplicator, but even a 1-31 machine can cost shy of £2,400, so we decided to use the humble Raspberry Pi and individual USB writers as a network, ending up with what appeared to originally look like a weeping willow SD card writer, only later to become more of an octopus – which fits into the Naturebytes family quite well we thought.

This repo is a how-to guide so you can build your own device if you ever feel the burning need to clone many hundreds of SD cards on the cheap.
